- **Own your content and infrastructure**
- **Avoid vendor lock-in**

## 🛠 Requirements

To self-host IndiePubStack, you'll need:

- ✅ A custom domain
- ✅ [Kinde](https://kinde.com) account (for authentication)
- ✅ [Resend](https://resend.com) account (for email delivery)
- ✅ A VPS or self-hosting provider (e.g. [Hetzner](https://hetzner.com), [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com))
- ✅ A PostgreSQL database
- ✅ [Coolify](https://coolify.io) (optional, for easy deployment)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

The easiest way to deploy IndiePubStack is using **Docker**. A prebuilt Docker image is available, and deployment can be automated via tools like [Coolify](https://coolify.io).

> **TODO:** Add complete Docker deployment instructions, including Coolify setup.

## 📦 Planned Hosting Options

In addition to traditional VPS hosting, we're working on support for **serverless deployments** using platforms like:
